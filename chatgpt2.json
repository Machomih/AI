{"question":"Why is every book I hear about a \" NY Times # 1 Best Seller \" ? ELI5 : Why is every book I hear about a \" NY Times # 1 Best Seller \" ? Should n't there only be one \" # 1 \" best seller ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Basically there are many categories of \" Best Seller \" . Replace \" Best Seller \" by something like \" Oscars \" and every \" best seller \" book is basically an \" oscar - winning \" book . May not have won the \" Best film \" , but even if you won the best director or best script , you 're still an \" oscar - winning \" film . Same thing for best sellers . Also , IIRC the rankings change every week or something like that . Some you might not be best seller one week , but you may be the next week . I guess even if you do n't stay there for long , you still achieved the status . Hence , # 1 best seller .","If you 're hearing about it , it 's because it was a very good or very well - publicized book ( or both ) , and almost every good or well - publicized book will be # 1 on the NY Times bestseller list for at least a little bit . Kindof like how almost every big or good movies are # 1 at the box office on their opening weekend .","One reason is lots of catagories . However , how the NY Times calculates its best seller list is n't comprehensive , and is pretty well understood by publishers . So publishers can [ buy a few books ] ( URL_0 ) in the right bookstores and send a book to the top of the list for at least a week ."],"chatgpt_answers":["There are many different best seller lists that are published by various organizations, and the New York Times is just one of them. The New York Times best seller list is a weekly list that ranks the best-selling books in the United States based on sales data from a number of different retailers. The list is published in the New York Times newspaper and is widely considered to be one of the most influential best seller lists in the book industry. \nIt's important to note that the New York Times best seller list is not the only best seller list out there, and there are many other lists that rank the top-selling books in different categories or in different countries. So it's possible that a book could be a best seller on one list but not on another. \nAdditionally, the term \"best seller\" is often used more broadly to refer to any book that is selling well, regardless of whether it is on a specific best seller list or not. So it's possible that you may hear about a book being a \"best seller\" even if it is not specifically ranked as a number one best seller on the New York Times list or any other list."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5"}
{"question":"If salt is so bad for cars , why do we use it on the roads ? As the title states , why do we use it ? is there no other option or what ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["salt is good for not dying in car crashes and car crashes are worse for cars then salt . Some places use other things , but salt is really cheap compared to most alternatives , although sand is pretty good .","In Minnesota and North Dakota , they tend to use sand , not salt . In these states , though , it is cold enough that the salt can not actually melt the snow , and so it refreezes and you end up with black ice on the roads , which is counterproductive . In other states whether there is snow but not so cold , wet asphalt is better than gritty snow for traction and so salt is favored for safety . Most people who live in states where salt is used , and by the way also in coastal cities , know that washing the car a couple times a week is critical .","Used to work in the salt industry ( yes , it 's a thing ) . Salt is one of the cheapest substances on earth . As in , you 'd be getting ripped off if you paid more than $ 150 per metric ton . ( In fact , the largest component of salt 's price is actually shipping . Yes , it costs more to transport salt than it does to produce it . ) Salt does its job ( lowering the freezing point of water ) incredibly effectively and is ludicrously abundant in nature . Its crystalline structure can also be manipulated in order to have sharper edges that reduce bounce . So that allows it to stick evenly to critical surfaces such as roads . Yes , there are alternatives . Usually salt \/ gravel mix or sugar beet based solutions . Those have less of an environmental impact when the spring melt washes it into the drain . This is more used in places where balance of water salinity for the safety of aquatic life is important . Propylene glycol , a water displacer , is even used in some places where it 's so cold that salt wo n't work effectively . But salt is by far the cheapest , most effective solution for preventing the icing of roads . And your government wants above all cheap and effective solutions that reduce winter accidents and keep people safe . They do n't care as much about the finish on your 1994 Honda Prelude ."],"chatgpt_answers":["Salt is used on roads to help melt ice and snow and improve traction during the winter months. When it's cold outside, water can freeze on the roads and make them very slippery, which can be dangerous for cars and people. Salt helps to melt the ice and snow by lowering the freezing point of water, which means that it can help keep the roads clear and safe to travel on. \nThere are other options for melting ice and snow on roads, such as using chemicals like calcium chloride or magnesium chloride, or using mechanical methods like plows or sand. However, salt is often the most effective and affordable option for many communities, especially when it's used in combination with other methods. \nIt's important to note that while salt can be helpful for making roads safer during the winter, it can also have negative effects on the environment and on the cars themselves. Salt can cause corrosion on metal surfaces, including cars, and it can also harm plants and animals if it washes into nearby waterways. However, despite these potential downsides, many communities continue to use salt as a way to keep roads clear and safe during the winter."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5"}
{"question":"Why do we still have SD TV channels when HD looks like SD on an old TV ? Could n't we just have the HD version of the channels & delete the SD ones ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["The way it works is that old TV stations got a certain amount of bandwidth to replace their old analog TV stations . However , HD takes up more bandwidth then SD - so the stations can choose between 2 or 3 HD stations , or like 7 or 8 SD stations ( or a mix of both ) They can do a bunch of SD stations and make more money in advertizing by running 7 or 8 different reruns of old SD TV shows at a time In fact , those stations often got permanent rights to show an unlimited number of reruns of old syndicated shows in perpetuity . That means they do n't even have to pay anyone to air old eppisodes of _ Star Trek _ or _ Alf _ So basically it 's free money for them , based on being around for a long , long time and having their old rights get upgraded as new technology comes out .","HD does n't look like anything at all on an SD TV . An old SD television ca n't even process the HD signal . We still have SD channels because there are still SD televisions out there .","There are a few reasons why SD channels still exist : 1 ) SD channels typically consume much less bandwidth than HD channels , so it is possible to carry many more SD channels than HD channels over the same coaxial cable or wireless spectrum ( for antenna broadcasts ) . This point does not apply when a television service provider carries both HD and SD versions of the same channel though . 2 ) Broadcasts formatted for HDTVs ( in 16x9 aspect ratio ) will typically have important details \/ information cut - off if displayed on an older 4:3 television screens . The SD - specific channels are often formatted especially for older 4:3 screens so that important graphics \/ information \/ details etc . do n't get cut - off . 3 ) Not all TVs \/ tuners are capable of receiving HD broadcasts even though they may be capable of receiving digital SD broadcasts . 4 ) With respect to cable TV , some cable companies still carry analog SD channels which can be received by older television sets without the need of a digital - to - analog adapter . If everything was switched to digital \/ HD , older televisions would need to be outfitted with a special adapter in order to receive service ( which is already the case in some areas ) . 5 ) A few televisions stations ( typically local \/ low - budget stations ) are still using old cameras , video processing and transmission equipment from the 90s or early 2000s and have n't yet invested in upgrading their equipment to support HD broadcasts ."],"chatgpt_answers":["There are a few reasons why we still have SD (standard definition) TV channels: \n1. Some people still use older TVs that are not compatible with HD (high definition) signals. These TVs can only display SD channels, so if we only had HD channels, those people wouldn't be able to watch TV. \n2. HD channels take up more bandwidth than SD channels, so it's not possible to have as many HD channels as we have SD channels. This means that if we only had HD channels, some channels might not be available. \n3. HD channels also require more expensive equipment to produce, so some TV stations might not be able to afford to upgrade to HD. \nOverall, it's important to have both SD and HD channels so that everyone can watch TV, regardless of what kind of TV they have or how much money they have."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5"}
{"question":"Why has nobody assassinated Kim Jong - un He is such a pest and nuisance to basically the entire world except for China . Why has n't anyone had him assassinated yet ? Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["You ca n't just go around assassinating the leaders of countries you do nt like ! The international condemnation would be brutal . Even though noone likes Kim Jong - Un , and everyone thinks North Korea is pretty shitty to its citizens , if say the US were to send agents over ( and do n't think they are n't capable of it ) and they got caught .... every country , every world leader would be a potential target . Who 's next ... Castro ? Angela Merkel ? Anyways , rumour has it that he 's ultra paranoid about exactly that and travels around in tanks and armoured trains that make Limo 1 look like a tonka toy .","It would n't really do any good . It 's not like North Korea would instantly convert to freedom - loving democracy if he died .","Partly because any country found to be doing so would incur China 's wrath , and generally look bad to the international community . Partly because destabilizing a government that has nuclear weapons is probably not a good idea . And partly because it likely is n't as easy as it sounds ."],"chatgpt_answers":["It is generally not acceptable or ethical to advocate for or condone the assassination of any individual, regardless of their actions or beliefs. There are also practical considerations at play in this situation. \nFirst and foremost, it is important to remember that assassination is a violent and extreme act that can have serious consequences, both for the person being targeted and for those around them. It can also lead to further conflict and instability in the region. \nAdditionally, the North Korean government is known for being highly secretive and heavily guarded, making it difficult for outsiders to carry out such an action. There may also be legal and diplomatic implications for any country or individual that attempts to assassinate the leader of another sovereign state. \nIt is important to seek peaceful and diplomatic solutions to conflicts and differences, rather than resorting to violence and assassination."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5"}
{"question":"How was airplane technology able to advance so quickly after the Wright Brothers ' first flight ? Mainly interested in how aviation was able to be deployed on a large scale during WWI . Please explain like I'm five.","human_answers":["Wanting to kill the shit out of Germans drives innovation .","This is a frequent phenomenon with technology : something is considered very hard or even impossible for a long , long time , and then one day , somebody figures it out . That opens a whole FLOODGATE of discovery leading to discovery , and the technology leaps forward quickly . Eventually , those chains of discovery start to play out , and the rate of advancement slows down , and may even come to a halt , perhaps starting up again years later when somebody discovers something new . We saw the same phenomenon with the building of the first transistor in 1947 . The * theory * of transistors had actually been known since the early 20th century , but nobody had figured out a way to actually build one . That led to an explosion in electronics , and when somebody figured out how to put a shitload of teensy transistors on a silicon wafer , the explosion exploded .","The importance of the Wright Brothers and other early inventors was to prove it could be done . Once proven , the rest is just a process of incremental improvements that add up over time . Keep in mind that while there are lots of nifty stuff in modern aircraft , the biggest thing in my opinion that makes modern aircraft possible are the engines and the only major change from 100 years ago has been from piston to turbine . Every other engine development is just making what we had the year before , a bit better , a bit lighter , a bit more powerful , a bit more reliable ."],"chatgpt_answers":["After the Wright Brothers made the first powered flight in 1903, people all around the world became interested in building and flying airplanes. Many people started working on designing and building airplanes, and as a result, airplane technology began to advance quickly. \nOne reason for this rapid advancement was the fact that airplanes were very useful for a number of different purposes. For example, airplanes were used for transportation, for carrying mail, for crop dusting, and for military purposes. This meant that there was a lot of demand for airplanes, which in turn encouraged more people to work on developing and improving airplane technology. \nDuring World War I, airplanes became even more important because they were used for fighting in the war. This led to even more rapid development of airplane technology as people tried to build airplanes that were faster, more maneuverable, and more durable. \nSo, in short, the reason that airplane technology was able to advance so quickly was because there was a lot of interest in airplanes and a lot of people working on developing and improving them. This was especially true during World War I, when the need for effective military airplanes was particularly pressing."],"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5"}
